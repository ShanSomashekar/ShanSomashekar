ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm Shanmuganathan Somashekar, a passionate and driven software developer with a focus on computational modeling and data analytics. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

ðŸŽ“ I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computational Modeling and Data Analytics at Virginia Tech, graduating in May 2023. Throughout my academic journey, I have gained a strong foundation in data analysis, statistical modeling, and programming languages such as R, SQL, Python, Java, and C. Additionally, I have a minor in Computer Science, which has further enhanced my technical skills.

ðŸ’» Here are some of the technical skills I have acquired along the way: R, SQL, Python, Java, C, Javascript, Jupyter Notebook, Rstudio, MATLAB, MS Office, Git, Tableau, Power BI, AWS, R Shiny, Linux, and various libraries such as Sci-kit-learn, NLTK, FinBert, spaCy, Pandas, NumPy, JSON, Beautiful Soup, MPI, Matplotlib, and PyTorch.

ðŸ”¬ I have gained practical experience through professional internships and research projects. As a Data Scientist intern at Kearney and Company, I developed Python scripts to scrape webpages and parse PDF links, saving significant storage space. I also implemented machine learning models using FinBERT and NLTK, resulting in accurate client segmentation for business opportunities. Additionally, I contributed to the development of interactive Tableau dashboards to visualize audit findings and drive new business opportunities.

ðŸŒ± During my time as an Undergraduate Researcher at Virginia Tech, I analyzed ticket sales data for the Moss Art Center using statistical models. Through data-driven insights, I identified revenue potential increases and collaborated with the marketing team to develop targeted promotions. I also created interactive dashboards that streamlined data analysis processes, saving time and improving efficiency.

ðŸ’¼ In addition to my academic and professional experiences, I have worked on various personal projects. One notable project is the Superstore Sales Analysis & Data Visualization, where I developed predictive models and a comprehensive sales dashboard using machine learning algorithms and Tableau. Another project focused on conducting in-depth analysis of NCAA Basketball Conference data, identifying performance patterns and providing recommendations for increased efficiency.

ðŸŒŸ I am enthusiastic about collaborating with fellow developers, exploring new technologies, and contributing to open-source projects. I believe in the power of data-driven decision-making and strive to create innovative solutions that make a positive impact. If you're interested in connecting or have any exciting opportunities, feel free to reach out to me through the contact information provided.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile. Let's connect and build amazing data-driven solutions together!
